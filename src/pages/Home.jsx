            I'm Vitor Diamantino, a passionate gamer since the age of 7, when I
            got my first Super Nintendo. That moment sparked a lifelong love for
            the art of games and their ability to tell unforgettable stories.
            Huolong Studios was born from this passion â€” a dream turned into a
            mission to create unique and engaging experiences.
